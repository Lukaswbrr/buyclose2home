A html project that looks for nearby products by using a JSON database.

This project was made for extension project in college.

## Disclaimer
Since i don't know how to add the node_modules to the actual github pages server, i created a folder
named github-pages with the files needed for the index to load.

If you know any ways in how i can add the node modules to the github pages, without adding it to the
repository, create a issue with the steps in how to do so or create a pull request.

Reminder that i also temporarily removed dist from .gitignore.

If you are going to contribute to this project, even though i don't know how to handle with the fact
that the node_modules folder ins't in the github pages server, then in the index.html file, change
every reference to github-pages folder and change it to node_modules.
